Hi humans!

Andrew here, I like to challenge myself.  I challenge myself to develop a game.  
I am currently working as an Electrician's Apprentice.  
After 1 and 1/2 years of on the job training I have effectively gained the ability to bring electrical power to any future residential or commercial buildings.  
Designing a game to challenge the great minds that humanity has to offer is my goal. 

Day 1:
Let's begin.
