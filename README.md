Hi humans!

Andrew here, I like to challenge myself.  I challenge myself to develop a game.  
I am currently working as an Electrician's Apprentice.  
After 1 and 1/2 years of on the job training I have effectively gained the ability to bring electrical power to any future residential or commercial buildings.  
Designing a game to challenge the great minds that humanity has to offer is my goal.

Little progress has been made.  This is directly related to my time prioritization lacking. I am excited to wake up tomorrow at 4:30am, brew a steaming cup of coffee and dig real deep into Linear Regression and modeling relationships with implementation.
