# hello-world
This is the first github in a long line of gitting that hub.  Learning in progress...


Hi humans!

Andrew here, I like to challenge myself.  I challenge myself to develop a game.  
I am currently working as an Electrician's Apprentice.  
After 1 and 1/2 years of on the job training I have effectively gained the ability to bring electrical power to any future residential or commercial buildings.  
Designing a game to challenge the great minds that humanity has to offer is my goal. 

Day 1:
Let's begin.

Little progress has been made.  This is directly related to my time prioritization lacking. I am excited to wake up tomorrow at 4:30am, brew a steaming cup of coffee and dig real deep into Linear Regression and modeling relationships with implementation.

GitHub tutorial is making progress.  I learned how to push/pull a git project into sublime text. 
git status 			#status of git versions

git commit -m 		#commits your changes locally

git add -A			#adds your new changes to local version

git push			#pushes local version to the github

git pull			#pulls the newest version of git


still confused on changes not being saved when just text is changed and not a new file added.  

UPDATE: learned how to ^ commit and push modiefied files with git
git commit -m "comment" <filename> 
git push


<escape> :wq     this is how to get out for a full commit
or a commit where you don't put -m

help window in cmd prompt by typing git

get clone <git link> 	#This is how you create a git folder wherever you want on your machine.
