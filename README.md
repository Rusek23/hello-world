# hello-world
This is the first github in a long line of gitting that hub.  Learning in progress...


Hi humans!

Andrew here, I like to challenge myself.  I challenge myself to develop a game.  
I am currently working as an Electrician's Apprentice.  
After 1 and 1/2 years of on the job training I have effectively gained the ability to bring electrical power to any future residential or commercial buildings.  
Designing a game to challenge the great minds that humanity has to offer is my goal. 

Day 1:
Let's begin. 


LearnCodeAcademy top 11 commands daily:

push, pull, add, rm, checkout, commit, branch, status, list, merge, diff

Little progress has been made.  This is directly related to my time prioritization lacking. I am excited to wake up tomorrow at 4:30am, brew a steaming cup of coffee and dig real deep into Linear Regression and modeling relationships with implementation.

GitHub tutorial is making progress.  I learned how to push/pull a git project into sublime text. 
git status 			#status of git versions

git commit -m 		#commits your changes locally

git add -A			#adds your new changes to local version

git push			#pushes local version to the github

git pull			#pulls the newest version of git


still confused on changes not being saved when just text is changed and not a new file added.  

UPDATE: learned how to ^ commit and push modiefied files with git
git commit -m "comment" <'filename'> 
git push

<'escape'> :wq     this is how to get out for a full commit
or a commit where you don't put -m

help window in cmd prompt by typing git

get clone <'git link'> 	#This is how you create a git folder wherever you want on your machine.

One year has passed. This knowledge was not used sufficiently to still hold strong a connection in my toolchest.  Nontheless it is an achievement upon which I can rediscover should the time arise.  git seems to be fairly common within the realm of many developers.  I cannot pretend to serioulsy continue down this path if I refrain from learning the basic toolsets of the prime leaders in this field.  To find an expert developer perhaps from Guild Wars itself, I may begin to understand how to develop a world and reality that will bring joy and fun to the minds of the masses.  What greated purpose could their be, to create A general shared experience, which is good.  What is good? Fun had for all, sports. Friendly competition where skill and wits are put to the test but rather than in the familar body extended external sports, eg. golf, hockey, football, I aim at an internal expression of the mind with little external physical movement, eg. chess, video games. 

Perhaps why the coach of a team is revered for their achievements when he/she raised no physical appendages during the sport but rather they are extensions of his/her mind.  

Fun in competition may not be the only class of enjoyment however.  Competition within ones own or that of the developer may also happen. Vicory or defeat may be the ultimate emotions felt in any class of sport.  Victory being a triumph and defeat its contrary. The Zero sum game. Fun may also be experienced in other non Zero sum games, participation trophys come to mind and may give some the sense of fullfillment. 

I have also been reading Rene Descarte's meditations recently and his method of reaching truth is what I have displayed somewhat poorly but it is my intent to record what I learn continue these git commits as a personal diary of sorts with explanations of things I am learning to reiterate them in my mind and not have so few enteries by next year 2/2022.  If it is my intent. So shall I will it. I intend to develop a game. So shall I will it. 

My first game:  How to Develop? What skills in the developers toolkit do I posses currently? Unity will be my tool of choice with completing this game, perhaps look into examples of cool unity completed games and emulate the style I enjoy the most or easiest on the eyes. The language of choice for development will be C# which is what is associated with Unity.  Learning the language will be the first and greatest hurdle to creation.  The smartest steps further would be to gain a fundamental base knowledge of the language.  Enough to be able to speak on a very basic fundamental basis. The same level of the amateur golfer who comes into a lesson with little knowledge but is given a toolset and theoretical understanding so they may apply a general rule until their muscles are molded into a more efficient player.  The same method I will use to learning game dev, hone a key set of fundamental tools so I can then Create a game, publish a game, support a game.  This will be my golf swing, from start to finish of a project.  Other difficulties will arrise however my full realised goal will be Create, Publish, Support.  An eye to the future creates the future.
